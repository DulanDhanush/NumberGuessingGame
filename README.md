# üéØ Number Guessing Game (Java)

Welcome to the **Number Guessing Game**, a fun and interactive console-based Java game where the user tries to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range. This project is perfect for beginners learning Java fundamentals such as loops, conditionals, user input, and random number generation.

## üìå Features

- Random number generation between 1 and 100
- Feedback on whether the guess is too high or too low
- Tracks the number of attempts
- Option to play multiple rounds
- Clean and readable console UI

## üöÄ Getting Started

2. Open your terminal or IDE.
3. Compile the code:

javac NumberGuessingGame.java

4.Run The Game

java NumberGuessingGame

##Concepts Used
->Scanner for user input
->Random for number generation
->do-while and if-else statements for game logic
->Input buffer handling with nextLine() to prevent issues after using nextInt()
